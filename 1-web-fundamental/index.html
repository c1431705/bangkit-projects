                <p>crossed our mind, if you become a teacher. Surely you feel the extraordinary experience that you will experience. Yes, to be honest, I have taught at a vocational school (SMK Tarakanita) in South Jakarta and the experience I got from this school is very valuable. Meeting students who are still 14 to 18 years of age where their emotions are still unstable. because, their entry in the adolescent phase. my students at that time, they were various characters.</p>
                    
                <p>their characters describe their feelings of independence or their feelings for their life as teenagers. This school has very strict rules, it is already very strict for students, let alone the many rules for the teachers. I myself am used to school rules. that the teacher's obedience will also be followed by the students. at least, at that time I was very strict about the school rules.

                <h2>Between The Classroom, Student and me</h2>
                <img src="img/2.jpg" alt="event2" class="featured-image">
                <p>Teaching can be a demanding profession. There are times when students can seem uninterested in learning and disruptive to the classroom environment. There are plenty of studies and educational strategies for improving student behavior. But personal experience may be the best way to show how to turn a difficult student into a dedicated pupil. I had such an experience: one where I was able to help change a student with major behavioral issues into a learning success story.</p>

                <h4><mark>Troubled Student</mark></h4>
                <p>MuridNakal was enrolled in my senior American government class for a semester, followed by a semester of economics. He had impulse-control and anger-management issues. He had been suspended many times in previous years. When he entered my class in his senior year, I assumed the worst.
                
                MuridNakal sat in the back row. I never used a seating chart with students on the first day; this was always my opportunity to get to know my pupils before assigning them to specific seats after a few weeks. Every time I talked at the front of the class, I would ask questions of students, calling them by name. Doing this—sans seating chart—helped me to get to know them and learn their names. Unfortunately, every time I called on MuridNakal, he would respond with a glib answer. If he got an answer wrong, he would become angry.
                
                About a month into the year, I was still trying to connect with MuridNakal. I can usually get students involved in class discussions or at least motivate them to sit quietly and attentively. By contrast, MuridNakal was just loud and obnoxious.</p>
                
                <h4><mark>Battle of Wills</mark></h4>
                <p>MuridNakal had been in so much trouble through the years that being a problem student had become his modus operandi. He expected his teachers to know about his referrals, where he was sent to the office, and suspensions, where he was given mandatory days to stay out of school. He would push every teacher to see what it would take to get a referral. I tried to outlast him. I had rarely found referrals to be effective because students would return from the office behaving worse than before.
                
                One day, MuridNakal was talking while I was teaching. In the middle of the lesson, I said in the same tone of voice, "MuridNakal why don't you join our discussion instead of having one of your own." With that, he got up from his chair, pushed it over and yelled something. I can't remember what he said other than that it included several profanity words. I sent MuridNakal to the office with a discipline referral, and he received a week-long out-of-school suspension.
                
                To this point, this was one of my worst teaching experiences. I dreaded that class every day. MuridNakal's anger was almost too much for me. The week MuridNakal was out of school was a wonderful hiatus, and we got a lot accomplished as a class. However, the suspension week would soon come to an end, and I dreaded his return.</p>
                
                <h4><mark>The Plan</mark></h4>
                <p>On the day of MuridNakal's return, I stood at the door awaiting him. As soon as I saw him, I asked MuridNakal to talk to me for a moment. He seemed unhappy to do it but agreed. I told him that I wanted to start over with him. I also told him that if he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he had my permission to step outside the door for a moment to collect himself.
                
                From that point on, MuridNakal was a changed student. He listened and he participated in class. He was a smart student, something I could finally witness in him. He even stopped a fight between two of his classmates one day. He never abused his break time privilege. Giving MuridNakal the power to leave the classroom showed him that he had the ability to choose how he would behave.
                
                At the end of the year, MuridNakal wrote me a thank you note about how well the year had gone for him. I still have that note today and find it touching to reread when I become stressed about teaching.</p>
                
                <h4><mark>Avoid Prejudgment</mark></h4>
                <p>This experience changed me as a teacher. I came to understand that students are people who have feelings and who don't want to feel cornered. They want to learn, but they also want to feel as if they have some control over themselves. I never made assumptions again about students before they came into my class. Every student is different; no two students react in the same way.
                
                It is our task as teachers to find not only what motivates each student to learn but also what causes them to misbehave. If we can meet them at that point and take away their reason to misbehave, we can go a long way toward achieving more effective classroom management and a better learning environment.

                <h2>Don't be to Stiff</h2>
                <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="event3" class="featured-image">
                <p>I was brought up in a conservative family and alternative school where girls rarely became something other than teachers, nurses or stay at home mothers. I realise now that this mentality was archaic for the early 1990s. I think my mother did as well, because I was half-heartedly encouraged to look at engineering, but always told it was good for a girl to have a trade. Something she can fall back on for when she had her babies.

                Teaching was a trade to my family. Teaching was considered to provide flexibility of hours that ensured I could still be the primary care giver and have a career.
                
                I resisted teaching and instead worked towards international studies because it was a good profession that incorporated my love of the social sciences, especially history. My guidance counsellor told me that no one from my school ever got their first preference. I thought I was being clever and put History teaching first, international studies second.
                
                I got my first preference. My first preference was in jakarta and I had a reason to escape the small town.
                
                So I trained as a secondary teacher.</p>
                
                <h4><mark>I stayed in teaching</mark></h4>
                
                <p>I’m not sure I ever really committed to teaching because I felt uncomfortable with the teaching bit all the way through my degree and for the first five years on the job (I loved the History and Social Science bit). But I was brought up to honour my commitments. It was embedded. “You always finish what you start, Naomi.” I can still hear my father’s Protestant Work Ethic in my ear. I also couldn’t think of anything else I could do that would allow me to be paid for working with History.
                
                One day I remember having a Year 10 class brutally destroy my love for History. I walked away from work that day at a crossroad. I stick out the profession or find a new one. If I was to stay I needed another reason to be there.
                
                The situation in the classroom was pretty bleak but as the weeks went on, evidence came to light that the key perpetrators of my disillusionment were in a pretty bad place. In fact, one of the most difficult students was being online bullied by the other culprits. It was pretty sophisticated bullying as well. Both the police and Microsoft got involved.
                
                Suddenly, I realised that teaching could not be about the subject I was teaching but it had to be about the students. I gave myself an ultimatum. I needed to be there for the students or leave.
                
                I stayed for eight more years.
